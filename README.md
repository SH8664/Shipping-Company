# Shipping-Company  :truck:

## Introduction

A shipping company needs to handle cargo delivery the most efficient and profitable way.
The company needs to automate the cargo-truck assignment process to achieve good and fair use
of its trucks. Fortunately, the company manager discovers your programming skills and your deep
knowledge of different data structures and decides to hire you to develop a program that simulates
the operation of the cargo delivery process and calculates some related statistics in order to
help improve the overall process.

## What do we learn ?? 

- Understand unstructured, natural language problem description and derive an appropriate
design.
- Intuitively modularize a design into independent components and divide these components
among team members.
- Build and use data structures to implement the proposed design.
- Write a complete object-oriented C++ program that performs a non-trivial task.
